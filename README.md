Integrated Oberon
=================

This project may eventually integrate modern capabilities into Oberon, a classic
operating system and language.

Meanwhile Linker.Mod (in oberon-risc-ethz) allows OberonV5 (2013) for RISC
to compile its own boot track from source code to a binary file, making the
system almost self-hosted. An additional tool (such as 'dd' on the host) is 
required to install the boot
track.

Using Linker.Mod
----------------

* Retrieve and compile Peter De Wachter's Oberon Risc Emulator
  (https://github.com/pdewacht/oberon-risc-emu)
* Retrieve a disk image from http://projectoberon.com (in S3RISCinstall.zip)
* Run the emulator: ./risc RISC.img
* From within the emulator execute the `PCLink1.Run` command
* Retrieve Linker.Mod and upload it (`./pcreceive.sh Linker.Mod` on the host)
* Obtain FileDir.Mod, Files.Mod, Kernel.Mod, and Modules.Mod and upload those as well.
* In the RISC emulator add a trailing /s to the Compile command 
  (e.g. `ORP.Compile ^/s`)
* Highlight '*.Mod' in the RISC emulator and execute the `System.Directory ^` command.
* Highlight `Tools.Mod` and then execute the `ORP.Compile ^/s` command.
* Execute the `Tools.Inspect 0` command. Observe that the last number of line E0 is `00000000`
* Highlight `FileDir.Mod` and then execute the `ORP.Compile ^/s` command.
* Do the same for `Files.Mod`, `Kernel.Mod`, and `Modules.Mod`.
* Type and then highlight the text 'Linker.Mod'
* Execute the `ORP.Compile ^/s` command.
* Type and then execute the command `Linker.Link Modules`
* From the command prompt on the host issue the command 
  `./pcsend.sh Modules.bin`

You can apply the newly compiled boot track to an existing floppy image
using the dd command, for example:

* `cp RISC.img RISC-INSTALLTEST.img`
* `dd if=Modules.bin of=RISC-INSTALLTEST.img bs=512 seek=524292 conv=notrunc`

You should then be able to run the emulator using the modified disk image and when you issue
the `Tools.Inspect 0` command you should observe `12345678` on the last line.
