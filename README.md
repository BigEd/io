Integraged Oberon
=================

This project may eventually integrate modern capabilities into a classic
operating system and language (Oberon.)

Meanwhile, Linker.Mod (in oberon-risc-ethz) allows OberonV5 (2013) for RISC
to compile its own boot track from source code to a binary file, making the
system almost self-hosted. An additional tool is required to install the boot
track.

Using Linker.Mod
----------------

* Retrieve, compile, and execute Peter De Wachter's Oberon Risc Emulator
  from https://github.com/pdewacht/oberon-risc-emu
* From within the emulator execute the `PCLink1.Run` command
* Retrieve Linker.Mod and from another command prompt on the host and then
  issue the command `./pcreceive.sh Linker.Mod`
* Add a trailing /s to the Compile command (e.g. `ORP.Compile ^/s`)
* Type and then highlight the text 'Linker.Mod'
* Execute the `ORP.Compile ^/s` command.
* Type and then execute the command `Linker.Link Modules`
* From the command prompt on the host issue the command 
  `./pcsend.sh Modules.bin`

You can apply the newly compiled boot track to an existing floppy image
using the dd command, for example:

`dd if=Modules.bin of=RISC-INSTALLTEST.img bs=512 seek=524292 conv=notrunc`
